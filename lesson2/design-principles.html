                    Freecodecamp is a very good example of a website whose elements and colours are so well arranged to give out the best
                    visual appearance and excitement. The font colour and font family are well selected and placed on very nice background
                    that provides a very effective contract! The contract of this website is excellent, I remember doing my html tutorials
                    efficiently as the readability of this website is just perfect!

                Proximity is about arranging elements in a way that creates relationships among them. Its helps the users to easily
                understand the content that is put on a website. One of the best websites that illustrates the principle of proximity is
                byupathway.org. The elements of this website are carefully arranged to give meaning to each group of text. You can see
                on this sign in page how the two separate logins are well described on which one is appropriate to use depending on what
                type of a student the user is.

                <h4>Codecademy</h4>
                <a href="https://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">codecademy.com</a>

                <p>
                    The design for Codecademy is amazing! The use of enough white space between well grouped texts
                    and excellent use of colours makes this website have a beautiful and clean design. The whitespace between the
                    company logo, menu and the image in this webpage shows the importance of using whitespace correctly, it does
                    not only add beauty to a web pages but enhances readability as well.
