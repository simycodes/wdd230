        <h1>Evaporation</h1>
        <p>
            Evaporation happens when a liquid substance becomes a gas. When water is heated, it evaporates. The molecules move and
            vibrate so quickly that they escape into the atmosphere as molecules of water vapor.
            
            Evaporation is a very important part of the water cycle. Heat from the sun, or solar energy, powers the evaporation
            process. It soaks up moisture from soil in a garden, as well as the biggest oceans and lakes. The water level will
            decrease as it is exposed to the heat of the sun.
            
            Although the level of a lake, pool, or glass of water will decrease due to evaporation, the escaped water molecules dont
            disappear. They stay in the atmosphere, affecting humidity, or the amount of moisture in the air. Areas with high
            temperatures and large bodies of water, such as tropical islands and swamps, are usually very humid for this reason.
            Water is evaporating, but staying in the air as a vapor.(https://www.nationalgeographic.org/)
