        <h1>Condensation</h1>
        <p>
            Condensation is the process by which water vapor in the air is changed into liquid water. Condensation is crucial to the
            water cycle because it is responsible for the formation of clouds. These clouds may produce precipitation, which is the
            primary route for water to return to the Earth's surface within the water cycle. Condensation is the opposite of
            evaporation.
            
            You don't have to look at something as far away as a cloud to notice condensation, though. Condensation is responsible
            for ground-level fog, for your glasses fogging up when you go from a cold room to the outdoors on a hot, humid day, for
            the water that drips off the outside of your glass of iced tea, and for the water on the inside of the windows in your
            home on a cold day.(https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/science/)
